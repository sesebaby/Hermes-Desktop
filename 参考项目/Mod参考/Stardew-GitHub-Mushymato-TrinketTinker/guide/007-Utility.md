This command toggles some debug drawing options:
- Companion sprite index: a sprite index will be drawn over the companion as they animate. This sprite index is positioned at the companion's "position".
- Companion bounding box: a magenta box is drawn around the companion, showing the zone used for [Interact proc](004-Ability.md) type and for [NoOverlap Lerp motion](003.z.000-Lerp.md).

### tt.unequip_trinket

Force unequip all trinkets and send the unequipped trinkets to lost and found. Mainly useful if a mod fails to properly remove their trinkets.
